## Exponential Regression in R (Step-by-Step)
#Exponential regression is a type of regression that can be used to model the following situations:
  
  #1. Exponential growth: Growth begins slowly and then accelerates rapidly without bound.
  #2. Exponential decay: Decay begins rapidly and then slows down to get closer and closer to zero.
 #y = ab^x   where:
    #y: The response variable
    #x: The predictor variable
    #a, b: The regression coefficients that describe the relationship between x and y
#Create the Data
#create some fake data for two variables: x and y:
  
x = 1:20
y = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 19, 23, 28, 33, 38, 44, 50, 56, 64, 73, 84, 97, 113)

#Visualize the Data
plot(x, y)

#fit the model
model <- lm(log(y)~ x)

#view the output of the model
summary(model)
